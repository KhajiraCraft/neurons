## Artifacts Overview

### 1. **Class Diagrams**

Class diagrams represent the structure of the system by showing the classes in the application, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. These diagrams are key to understanding the data model and behavior of the system.

- **ClassDiagram_Summary**: Represents the `Summary` class that handles summarization tasks.
- **ClassDiagram_User**: Represents the `User` class, including user authentication and profile management.
- **ClassDiagram_QuizResultsHistory**: Represents the `QuizResultsHistory` class that stores quiz results for users.

### 2. **Activity Diagrams**

Activity diagrams show the workflow or process logic of the system. They are used to visualize the sequence of activities and decisions in a process.

- **Activity Diagram_Diagram 1_Generate Summary and Quiz**: Visualizes the process flow for generating summaries and quizzes, including user interaction, processing, and output generation.

### 3. **Object Diagrams**

Object diagrams show a snapshot of the objects in the system at a particular point in time. They are used to represent specific instances of the classes defined in the class diagrams.

- **ObjectDiagram_MultiObjects**: Represents instances of objects interacting during summarization and quiz generation processes.

### 4. **Sequence Diagrams**

Sequence diagrams describe how objects interact in a particular scenario in terms of sequence of messages exchanged. They are essential for understanding the flow of control between system components.

- **SequenceDiagram_GenerateQuiz**: Visualizes the sequence of operations for generating a quiz based on the summary provided.

### 5. **Use Case Diagrams**

Use case diagrams show the interactions between actors (users or systems) and the system itself. These diagrams are critical for understanding the user interactions with the system.

- **UseCase1_ContentSummarization**: Describes the interaction for content summarization. It shows how users submit content and receive summaries.
- **UseCase2_OutputHandling**: Describes how the system handles output, such as presenting summaries and quizzes to the user.
- **UseCase3_ProgressTracking**: Visualizes the process for tracking user progress, such as quiz results and summary generation history.
- **UseCase4_UserAccount**: Describes the user account management flow, including registration, login, and profile updates.

### 6. **Window Navigation Diagrams**

Window navigation diagrams show the user interface layout and the navigation flow between different windows or pages in the system.

- **WindowNavDiagram_Summary&Quiz**: Describes the layout and flow of windows related to summary and quiz generation.

### 7. **Progress Presentation Slides**

- **Progress Presentation Slides.pdf**: A presentation summarizing the progress of the project, including key design decisions, diagrams, and features implemented.

## Traceability Links

Each artifact is associated with specific functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring that the system design aligns with the project goals. The traceability links map the relationship between the artifacts and the requirements, helping to track how the design decisions address the specified system functionality.

For example:
- **Use Case Diagrams** map interactions with users and system functions to relevant requirements.
- **Class Diagrams** show how system entities and their relationships satisfy data handling and processing requirements.
- **Sequence Diagrams** visualize the order of system operations, demonstrating how requirements are addressed in the flow of actions.
- **Activity Diagrams** outline workflows that are linked to processes necessary to fulfill requirements.
- **Window Navigation Diagrams** describe the user interface flow and are linked to user experience-related requirements.

## Usage

Each artifact can be referenced for understanding the design decisions, development progress, and how the system was structured to meet the requirements. They are especially useful for future enhancements, debugging, and verifying that the final system meets the defined functional and non-functional requirements.

## Conclusion

The artifacts in this folder provide a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, design, and progress. They are instrumental in ensuring that the project meets all requirements and can be easily understood, modified, and extended in the future.
