## Discussion Points  

### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements  
**Reviewed the drafted requirements:**  

#### Functional Requirements  
- User authentication (registration, login, password reset).  
- Summarization of user-provided text with configurable summary length.  
- Quiz generation based on summarized text, with customizable parameters (e.g., number of questions).  
- Analytics dashboard to display user progress and performance trends.  

#### Non-Functional Requirements  
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.  
- Error handling for invalid inputs and API failures.  
- **Performance:** Summarization and quiz generation should take less than 15 seconds for standard inputs.  

### Feedback and Adjustments  
- **Imelda:** Proposed including accessibility considerations in the UI design.  
- **Christopher:** Suggested adding specific error messages for common issues (e.g., invalid text input, API timeout).  

### Planning Documentation  
- Agreed to use Markdown files in GitHub to document requirements, so they remain easily accessible.
