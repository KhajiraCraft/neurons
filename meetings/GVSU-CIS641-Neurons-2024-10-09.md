## Discussion Points  

### Use Case Development  
- **Imelda** created the use cases and defined the key scenarios:  
  - **Use Case 1:** User logs in and accesses their dashboard.  
  - **Use Case 2:** User inputs text for summarization and receives a summarized output.  
  - **Use Case 3:** User generates a quiz, interacts with it, and views their score.  
  - **Use Case 4:** User views analytics showing progress trends over time.  

### Sequence Diagrams  
- **Christopher** created a sequence diagram for the **text summarization workflow**:  
  - User → Frontend → Backend → LLM API → Backend → Frontend.  
- **Imelda** outlined the sequence for **user authentication**:  
  - User → React Authentication Form → Frontend Dashboard.  

### Project Considerations  
- Decided to prioritize summarization and quiz generation functionality before analytics.
