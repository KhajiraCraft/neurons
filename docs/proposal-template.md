# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

We are edeveloping a web application that will assist students to summarize long and complex educational content into simpler and understable material.The application will use Large langauage models (LLM) with predefined prompts fed to agents to provide customized summaries.

The application could cater to various educational levels including both university and highschool students.In addition, users will be able to generate quizes based on the summaries to foster understanding.

The user interface will allow users to login and prompt the application. The application will respond by providing a summary. It will also allow the user to track their progress and analyse areas where they struggle so as to provide targeted explanations to make them understand better.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

For the frontend we intend to use the React framework with tailwind CSS
For the backend we will use the OpenAI API, and Python agents.
We will also use Firebase for login and authentication.

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

For this project we will use agile methodology.Here is an estimated plan of attack that we will adapt for our semester project:

INITIALIZING THE PROJECT -  
We will begin by defining the scope of the project, the system requirements and list all the features and user stories as part of the backlog that we intend to implement. We will have sprints of one week since the time we have to complete the project is limited.

SPRINT PLANNING -
We will have meetings every Wednesday for sprint planning to discuss the priority features from the backlog that we need to work on. We will go through the application together as a team and do a retrospective where we shall discuss what went well and what did not for that sprint and how to improve in the next sprint.

DEVELOPMENT -
Tasks from the backlog will be implemented itireratively.The frontend developer will build the user interface that the user will interact with while  the backend developer will set up the API and connect the LLM to the backend.Unit tests and integration tests will be implemented by the whole team.The development cycle should take roughly 7 weeks.

DAILY STANDUPS -
We will also have 5 minute daily standups  to know the progress of each team member's tasks that week.

COLLABORATION -
During each sprint,we will work in collaboration as much as we can despite having clear roles defined for every member of the group. This will help us sail through the project smoothly without any form of blocakges .

Using agile methodology will enable adaptability and continuous improvement of the application which will be very beneficial when it comes to presenting a viable product at the end of the specified timeline.


# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

Research and planning - 2 days
Milestone: Determine the scope of the application by researching the key features and user requirements.

Model development and fine-tuning - 2 weeks
Milestones: 
-Develop agent prompts to improve summarization.
-Connect the backend to the OpenAI.

Frontend and Backend development - 3 weeks
Milestones: 
-Develop login and authentication.
-Design and develop grapic user interface that the user can use to prompt the system. 

Test and Validate:
-Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the program runs smoothly.


# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)

Latency- The LLM might take some time before providing a response to the user.You would need to put in place features such as loading bars to ensure that users know their request is being processed

Given LLMs are general models, they may struggle with specialized subjects such as medicine and may need to be fine tuned.
