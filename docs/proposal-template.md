# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

We are edeveloping a web application that will assist students to summarize long and complex educational content into simpler and understable material.The application will use Large langauage models (LLM) with predefined prompts fed to agents to provide customized summaries.

The application could cater to various educational levels including both university and highschool students.In addition, users will be able to generate quizes based on the summaries to foster understanding.

The user interface will allow users to login and prompt the application. The application will respond by providing a summary. It will also allow the user to track their progress and analyse areas where they struggle so as to provide targeted explanations to make them understand better.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

For the frontend we intend to use the React framework with tailwind CSS
For the backend we will use the OpenAI API, and Python agents.
We will also use Firebase for login and authentication.

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)



# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

Research and planning - 2 days
Milestone: Determine the scope of the application by researching the key features and user requirements.

Model development and fine-tuning - 2 weeks
Milestones: 
-Develop agent prompts to improve summarization.
-Connect the backend to the OpenAI.

Frontend and Backend development - 3 weeks
Milestones: 
-Develop login and authentication.
-Design and develop grapic user interface that the user can use to prompt the system. 

Test and Validate:
-Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the program runs smoothly.


# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)

Latency- The LLM might take some time before providing a response to the user.You would need to put in place features such as loading bars to ensure that users know their request is being processed

Given LLMs are general models, they may struggle with specialized subjects such as medicine and may need to be fine tuned.
