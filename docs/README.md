## Documents Overview

### 1. **Proposal.pdf**

The *Proposal* document presents the project's goals, scope, timeline, and resources. It serves as the initial planning document, detailing the motivation behind the project, the problem it seeks to address, and the approach taken to design and develop the web application. 

Key sections of the proposal include:
- **Introduction**: A brief overview of the project, the problem it solves, and the target audience.
- **Objectives**: Specific goals to be achieved during the project.
- **Scope**: Description of what is included and excluded from the project.
- **Methodology**: The approach and technologies to be used in building the web application.
- **Timeline**: A high-level schedule of key project milestones.
- **Resources**: Information on the development tools, team members, and other resources needed.

### 2. **Software_Requirements_Document.pdf**

The *Software Requirements Document (SRD)* provides a detailed and technical description of the functional and non-functional requirements for the *Neurons* web application. This document is critical for guiding development and ensuring that all system components meet the project’s objectives.

Key sections of the SRD include:
- **System Overview**: A high-level view of the web application and its purpose.
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed specifications of the system’s features, including user stories, use cases, and data flows.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Specifications for performance, security, scalability, and usability.
- **System Architecture**: A description of the system’s architecture, including high-level diagrams and components.
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed technical requirements, such as programming languages, frameworks, and hardware or software dependencies.
- **Assumptions and Constraints**: Any assumptions made during the project and the constraints that may affect the system’s design or implementation.

## Purpose

These documents serve as the foundation for the development process:
- **The Proposal** defines the initial vision of the project and the scope of work.
- **The Software Requirements Document** provides a more technical and detailed account of the system’s functionality, performance, and constraints, ensuring that development aligns with the set expectations.

## Usage

- **Proposal**: Refer to this document for an overview of the project's purpose and high-level goals. It is particularly useful during the early stages of development or when presenting the project to stakeholders.
  
- **Software Requirements Document**: This document is critical for developers, testers, and project managers. It should be referenced to ensure the system's design and implementation match the required specifications and to track project progress against the defined functional and non-functional requirements.

## Conclusion

The documents in this folder provide the critical blueprints for the *Neurons* web application. They ensure that the team is aligned with the project objectives and that the system will meet the necessary technical standards. These documents also serve as a reference point for future work and for understanding the system’s design decisions.
